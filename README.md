  <h1>Data Segmentation using Kohonen Algorithm - Documentation</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This project focuses on performing data segmentation, also known as clustering, using the Kohonen algorithm. The objective is to identify patterns and clusters within the dataset of the bank customers. We have implemented the project using Jupyter Notebook as IDE and mainly Python as a programming language, which provides a versatile and powerful environment for data analysis and machine learning tasks.
  </p>

  <h2>Installation</h2>
  <p>
    To run the code for this project, ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python Downloads</a>.
    <br>
    Additionally, we will be utilizing various Python libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn. You can install these libraries using pip, a package installer for Python. Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command:
  </p>
  <pre><code>pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn</code></pre>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.</li>
    <li>Open the project in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.</li>
    <li>Make sure you have the necessary dataset(s) available for clustering.</li>
    <li>Modify the code to load and preprocess your dataset(s), including handling missing data if applicable.</li>
    <li>Run the code and observe the output for the clustering results.</li>
    <li>Utilize the provided visualization techniques to gain insights into the formed clusters and make informed decisions.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Implementation Overview</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Load the dataset(s) and perform any necessary data cleaning and preprocessing.</li>
        <li>Handle missing data using appropriate techniques like imputation or removal.</li>
        <li>Scale the data to ensure all features have a similar range.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Kohonen Algorithm:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Initialize a Kohonen grid with random weights for each neuron.</li>
        <li>Train the grid using the input data to adjust the neuron weights iteratively.</li>
        <li>Determine the best matching unit (BMU) for each input sample.</li>
        <li>Update the weights of the BMU and its neighboring neurons based on a learning rate and neighborhood function.</li>
        <li>Repeat the training process for multiple iterations to refine the cluster formation.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Clustering:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Assign each input sample to its corresponding cluster based on the BMU.</li>
        <li>Group samples mapped to the same neuron to identify clusters.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Utilize various visualization techniques to gain insights into the formed clusters.</li>
        <li>Generate scatter plots, heatmaps, or use dimensionality reduction methods like t-SNE to visualize the data and cluster assignments.</li>
        <li>Handle missing data appropriately during visualization.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Resources and References</h2>
  <p>
    We referred to various resources and references during the project implementation to understand and apply the Kohonen algorithm. These include online tutorials, videos (e.g., YouTube), and relevant documentation. By leveraging these resources, we gained a deeper understanding of the algorithm and its implementation details.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    In this project, we successfully implemented the Kohonen algorithm for clustering. Using Python and its associated libraries, we could preprocess the data, train the Kohonen grid, perform clustering, and visualize the results. The project provides a valuable tool for identifying patterns and clusters in datasets, enabling data-driven decision-making and insights.
