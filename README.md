# Bank-Customers-Clustering
In this project, we implemented the Kohonen algorithm for data segmentation, also known as clustering, using Python. The Kohonen algorithm, also called Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), is an unsupervised learning technique that maps input data to a lower-dimensional grid, allowing us to identify clusters or patterns in the data.
